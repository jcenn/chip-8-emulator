# [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator implementation in C++
WIP
Test roms were borrowed from https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite
Currently able to render first 2 test roms in the terminal

Current goals:
- implementing all cpu opcodes
- adding dedicated rendering library (likely raylib and/or ncurses)
